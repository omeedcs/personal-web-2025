# The LLM Fear Mongering

I recently came across a quote by Yann LeCun that stuck with me: 

> "Inventing new things requires a type of skill and ability that you are not going to get from LLMs." 

It's a simple statement, but it cuts through a lot of the noise we hear about artificial intelligence today. And I think it's spot on.

## The Core Truth

I fundamentally believe that as long as this remains true, fields like computer science, engineering, law, the arts - and so many others - will stay not just relevant, but **essential** to pursue and study. Anyone claiming otherwise, telling you that AI will render human effort obsolete, is likely fear-mongering for their own gain. Don't buy it.

## Moore's Law and Human Ingenuity

Think about Moore's Law for a second - the observation that computing power doubles roughly every couple of years. It's not just a rule about silicon chips; to me, it reflects a deeper philosophy of progress. 

You could argue there's a parallel law at play: **human ingenuity scales alongside our tools**. 

As technology accelerates, so does our capacity to learn, think critically, and invent - not because machines take over the heavy lifting, but because we wield them. The better our tools get, the more we're challenged to step up, to master them, to push beyond what they can do alone.

That's the beauty of it.

## What LLMs Can and Can't Do

Large language models like the ones powering chatbots or writing assistants can:
- Churn out text
- Analyze data
- Even mimic creativity to a point

But **invention?** True, original creation? 

That's still ours. It's the spark that comes from:
- Wrestling with a problem
- Seeing connections where none existed before
- Daring to fail and try again

No algorithm's going to replicate that - not yet, and maybe not ever.

## We're in a Golden Age of Learning

So here's my take: we're not in an era where AI replaces us. We're in a **golden age of learning**. 

The tools we have today amplify what's possible, but they don't erase the need for human curiosity, grit, or imagination. If anything, they demand more of it. 

- Study the fields that excite you
- Build things
- Ask questions
- Stay curious

Because that's how we keep writing the story of progress.

## Final Thoughts

Yes, LLMs are powerful. Yes, they're changing how we work. But they're tools, not replacements. They're accelerants, not substitutes for human creativity and invention.

The fear-mongering around AI "taking our jobs" or "making education pointless" is exactly thatâ€”fear-mongering. Usually by people who either:
1. Don't understand the technology deeply enough
2. Have something to sell you
3. Want to sound contrarian for attention

Don't fall for it. Learn how to use these tools. Understand their limitations. And most importantly, **keep inventing**. Because that's something only humans can do.

Stay curious, my friends.
